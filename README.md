This project is one of my favorite logic games. I always enjoyed solving puzzles and complex problems and that's why I decided to build this game from the ground. However, the main reason is that whenever I want more challenging or complex game, there is limited availability presented prbably due to its such niche market. Additionally, most of the levels within the games I've played are hardcoded and once you complete anywhere 10-100 levels that will be it. Going into this project I was looking into building a function which would reverse back the process from the end to the beginning and although it is not completed in this version, that is something I'm currently working on. That's one of the features I would like to focus on and definitely add to the game. I also would like to create an option for user's input on what colors they prefer the balls to be and subsequently it would determine the complexity of the level depending on how many colors they input. 

In this game I utilized minimum html with big concentration on css and javascript. I wanted to make this game appealing and unique as I complete it and so it is entertaining for other people as well who might not enjoy solving puzzles the way as I do by creating animations and some cool features such as pop-up FAQ window or ability to restart the level when user experience a hardship.
